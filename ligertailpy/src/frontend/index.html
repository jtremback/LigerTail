About Page {
At LigerTail, we see big changes coming. At the heart of our adventure is the belief
 in openness - open algorithms, ideas, and information. 
Together, we can expand the pie in the digital world; it isnÕt a zero-sum game. 
With this our credo and guide, we will democratize advertising. 

When everyone contributes, everyone wins. 
Publishers add to their content with external, relevant links. 
Advertisers get more attention and engagement. Most importantly, we move into the future - where everyone gets a clean interface and ad space is filled with relevant content. 
The Internet is for everyone, why shouldnÕt advertising be?

With LigerTail, everyone can be heard. We envision a world where 
advertising is synonymous with relevant content. our widget is just the beginning. 
Join us in reshaping the internet for all of us!

Remember, itÕs the motion of the ocean.
