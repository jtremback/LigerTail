 The ordering algorithm is calculated the following way:
</p>
<p>
 Tier 0 - priced items. All items that are paid for with number of views < num_views_threshold.
 This gives top priority to the items that are paid for, to acquire necessary stats
</p>
<p>
 Tier 1 - quality content. These are items whose stats are known (views > num_views_threshold)
 and whose engagement is high.
 The engagement is a value 0..1 (1 being the highest, when every view results in
 a user action)
 The engagement rate is calculated (ctr - click through rate, clr - close rate):
<b> ctr * ctr_factor - clr * (1 - ctr_factor) </b>
</p>
<p>
 Tier 2 - better than ads. Disregarding the number of views, just high enough engagement
 factor. (tier2_engagement_threshold < item engagement < tier1_engagement_threshold)
</p>
<p>
 Tier 3 - questionable pool. All other items who don't have enough stats, with the 
 priority given to fewer views. This gives a chance to all items to be shown.
</p>
<p>
 Tier 2 and Tier 3 are interleaved with the ratio tier2_tier3_ratio
